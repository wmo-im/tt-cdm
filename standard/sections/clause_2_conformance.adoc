== Conformance

Conformance with this standard SHALL be checked using the tests specified in Annex A (normative) of this document.

The _OGC Abstract Specification Topic 20: Observations, Measurements and Samples_ standard (OGC-OMS) defines a
conceptual schema for observations. This includes the specification of abstract and logical models for the exchange of
information on the observations including, _inter alia_, the result of the observations and the processes and procedures
used to make or collect the observation. The standard defined herein is an extension of the
**http://www.opengis.net/spec/om/3.0/req/obs-basic/Observation** requirements class. Conformance with this standard
requires demonstrated conformance to the applicable OGC-OMS Conformance Classes, notably
**http://www.opengis.net/spec/om/3.0/conf/obs-basic/Observation** and related classes.

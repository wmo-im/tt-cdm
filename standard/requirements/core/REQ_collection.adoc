^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/core/featureCollection*
^|A | When a CDM record contains an observation collection the ``features`` property SHALL represent each observation
in the collection as a single ``feature``. Each ``feature`` in turn SHALL conform with this standard.
^|B | When the observations in the collection share a common location the location SHALL be encoded in the
``common.geometry`` property.
^|C | When the observations in the collection include the ``common.geometry`` property the corresponding
``features[...].geometry`` MAY be set to ``null``.
^|D | Properties common to all observations in the collection SHALL be included in ``common.properties`` property.
^|E | When a property is included in ``common.properties`` this SHALL be omitted or set to null for each observation
in the collection.

For example, if the record contains ``common.properties.observedProperty`` then
``features[...].properties.observedProperty`` shall be set to ``null`` or omitted for
each observation in the collection.
